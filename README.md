# ParallelProcessingSystems
Semester project for "Parallel Processing Systems" course in NTUA.  
The project consists of 4 separate parts and has to do with both shared and distributed memory architectures  
as well as with GPUs.  

During the project, **OpenMP**, **CUDA** and **MPI** were used to parallelize common algorithms, like the kmeans algorithm,  
the Floyd-Warshall algorithm and the heat equation problem.  

In our full report (written in Greek), we present an analysis that delves into topics such as speedup and scalibility  
of the problems examined and comparisons of different approaches to the same problem. The output files of all the runs  
of the algorithms are also included in the repo.
